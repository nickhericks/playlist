                    Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are an American rock band from Gainesville, Florida. In 1976, the band's original lineup was Tom Petty as the lead singer and guitar player, Mike Campbell as the lead guitarist, Ron Blair on bass, Stan Lynch on drums, and Benmont Tench on keyboards. The band has largely maintained this lineup, with a few exceptions. In 1981, Blair, who was tired of the touring lifestyle, left the band. Blair's replacement, Howie Epstein, stayed with the band for the next twenty years. Scott Thurston joined the band as a multi-instrumentalist, mostly rhythm guitar and second keyboards, in 1991. Blair returned to the Heartbreakers in 2002, the year before Epstein's death. In 1994, Steve Ferrone replaced Lynch. <span class="smaller">(Listen to '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6pLVzHPKc" title="Listen to Room At The Top on YouTube." target="_blank">Room At The Top</a>' on YouTube)</span>

                    Willie Hugh Nelson is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album <i>Shotgun Willie</i> (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of <i>Red Headed Stranger</i> (1975) and <i>Stardust</i> (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound.  <span class="smaller">(Listen to '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmhLuX0fTD4" title="Listen to The Maker on YouTube." target="_blank">The Maker</a>' on YouTube)</span>
